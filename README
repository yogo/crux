== Crux Experiment Management 

Crux is a Ruby on Rails application coupled with a Flex app to provide a way to describe databases via experimental protocols.  


== Getting Set up

Setting up the development and production environments requires setting up several database/web stacks.

=== Core App

- Clone the repository from http://github.com/yogo/crux.git.  
- Copy the database.example.yml file to database.yml and add the appropriate users/passwords.
- Create a mysql database that matches the database.yml values

NOTE: though there is a section for postgres, it is not currently used.

=== Persevere

- Download the persevere.tgz file from the Forge project, and unzip it to the vendor/ directory
- Run the `rake persvr:create` task to make the db/persvr files

=== BlazeDS Tomcat Stack

- Download the blazeds.tgz file from the Forge project, and unzip it to the vendor/ directory

=== Initialize the Databases

- Run `rake persvr:start`
- Run `rake db:seed`
- Browse to the persevere explorer interface on port 8080, make sure that there are classes for the Kefed models ('`KefedModel`') and the yogo models ('`crux__yogo_model`'). NOTE: The name of the yogo models class is a holdover from an earlier version of yogo, it doesn't affect the running of the system.

=== Run the system

- Run `rake persvr:start`
- Run `rake tomcat:start`
- Run `rails server`
- Browse to http://localhost:3000 and play with your new crux install!
